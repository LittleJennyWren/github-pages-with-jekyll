Hi everyone, 
Welcome to Rainbow!

I'm really exited to have you here, hopefully your exited too!
Rainbow is a country in the continent of Domastacastagaya (the other countries in this continent are worth checking out too, more on that later)
and has served as a peaceful country for animals and birds, like myself for millions of years. 
[And is free of Covid 19 and will be forever] 

## The pros

✅ Friendly citizens

✅ Very few natural and man made disasters (last one was a volcano in 1874, the last volcano) 

✅ Fantastic restaurants (food) , attractions and landmarks

✅ Great for pedestrians and cyclers

✅ Good music

✅ Good job opportunities 

✅ Lots of support when  taking on a courier, there has been extremely successful celebs come
  out of Rainbow, like Cara Sung 

✅ Proper education 

✅ Great hotels, accommodations, B&Bs, houses and apartments

✅ Electricity, internet, heating, the whole thing 

## The cons

❌ Limited driving

❌ Not many flights

❌  a person with a fear of any animal, not including spiders, lions, tigers, cheetahs, dragons and elephant birds, watch out, they're coming. 

❌ Can be hard to get there
